<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Please go out with me!</font>

2
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:16,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, um... this is all kind of sudden for me.</font>

3
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:19,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Can you give me some time to think?</font>

4
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:29,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why didn't you just turn her down?</font>

5
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:34,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is between me and Komari-chan. 
It isn't up to you.</font>

6
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, sure. We've never been more
 than childhood friends, anyway.</font>

7
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:50,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nothing but childhood friends, right?!</font>

8
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:57,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I just want to forget all this 
and light some black snakes.</i></font>

9
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:34,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>From what the president said, 
it sounds like Komari might have a chance.</i></font>

10
00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:37,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I never thought Tsukinoki-senpai 
might end up as a losing heroine.</i></font>

11
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:38,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Whoa!</font>

12
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:41,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Were you in here this whole time?</font>

13
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:44,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can't decide which one to go after.</font>

14
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:46,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nukumizu...</font>

15
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:49,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Can I ask your advice?</font>

16
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:51,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I don't believe this guy.</i></font>

17
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:54,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>That's basically like asking a worm
how to defeat a goldfish!</i></font>

18
00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:01,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I confessed to Koto once, 
but she turned me down.</font>

19
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:01,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

20
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:06,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you serious? This must've been 
when you were, like, four or five, right?</font>

21
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:09,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why do you say that? 
It was last Christmas.</font>

22
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:10,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>That's kind of recent.</i></font>

23
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:15,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why did she act like that after 
she'd already turned me down?</font>

24
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It doesn't make any sense.</font>

25
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:22,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Judging by how she reacted, 
there might be some misunderstanding.</font>

26
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:26,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">First of all, you should go back 
and have a good talk with her.</font>

27
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you...</font>

28
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:31,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you actually really
 experienced in love?</font>

29
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:32,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Why would you think that?</i></font>

30
00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:40,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Try swallowing first.</i></font>

31
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:43,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Tsukinoki-senpai took her things and left!</font>

32
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:46,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Where's she gonna go this late?</font>

33
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I have no idea.</font>

34
00:03:58,260 --> 00:03:59,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Koto.</font>

35
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:08,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I thought you turned me down 
when I asked you out last Christmas.</font>

36
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:12,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh? Turned you down? Me?</font>

37
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:17,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You know. By that tree at the station. 
You said, "Yeah, in your dreams."</font>

38
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:22,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I think you said, "If you can't find someone to 
marry you, I guess I could fill in, so don't worry."</font>

39
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:23,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is that when?</font>

40
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:28,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>That's what the president meant by a 
"confession"? That's worse that I imagined!</i></font>

41
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:33,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">On Christmas? Is that how you ask 
someone out on Christmas? In high school?</font>

42
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:35,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you completely brain dead?!</font>

43
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've been waiting...</font>

44
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:45,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">All this time, I've been waiting for you.</font>

45
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:47,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Waiting and waiting.</font>

46
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:49,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Koto, I'm sorry.</font>

47
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:53,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's go, Yanami-san.</font>

48
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:56,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh? But it's just starting to get good.</font>

49
00:04:57,190 --> 00:04:59,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey. Nukumizu-kun?</font>

50
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:03,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Could you—</font>

51
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:04,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We gotta go.</font>

52
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:05,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Um...</font>

53
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:08,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We need to give them some space.</font>

54
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:13,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh? What is it?</font>

55
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:16,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I mean, uh, my hand?</font>

56
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:18,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you ever gonna let go of it?</font>

57
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:23,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">O-Oh, sorry! I-I-I didn't mean anything by it.</font>

58
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm really sorry.</font>

59
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:27,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You don't need to apologize <i>that</i> much.</font>

60
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:34,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's this, Nukumizu-kun? 
Do you have something to confess to me?</font>

61
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:36,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">N-No, I don't.</font>

62
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:40,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Fine with me. Go right ahead. 
I'll turn you down, though.</font>

63
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:43,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I just said I don't!</font>

64
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:49,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh? Nuk-kun, what are you doing out here?</font>

65
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:51,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What are <i>you</i> doing, Yakishio?</font>

66
00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:53,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Looking for stag beetles.</font>

67
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:56,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I want to give one to 
Komari-chan to cheer her up.</font>

68
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:59,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>What makes you think a 
beetle will cheer her up?</i></font>

69
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:01,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Check this one out. It's huge!</font>

70
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:04,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's in your hands now, Nuk-kun.</font>

71
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:09,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I-I just talked to the president.</font>

72
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:16,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">H-He said no. Formally turned me down.</font>

73
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:21,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He did, huh? He actually 
gave you a straight answer?</font>

74
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:27,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">N-Nukumizu, I bet you would've 
chickened out and made me wait.</font>

75
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:29,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How did you guess?</font>

76
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Y-You really are a jerk.</font>

77
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:37,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The president actually thought about it.</font>

78
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:44,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He seriously considered
g-going out with me.</font>

79
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:50,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">For just a second,

80
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:57,600

00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:06,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">For sure.</font>

132
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:09,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yanami's got bad taste.</font>

133
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah.</font>

134
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:12,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't even know what he looks like, though.</font>

135
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:17,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So what are they to each other, anyway?</font>

136
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:18,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Who knows?</font>

137
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:21,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I guess I don't really get Yanami, either.</font>

138
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:22,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No kidding.</font>

139
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Let's go.</font>

140
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:47,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That was pretty rude, Nukumizu-kun.</font>

141
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:48,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

142
00:10:49,210 --> 00:10:50,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You totally ignored me.</font>

143
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:53,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, I wasn't trying to.</font>

144
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:56,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh. I guess that's okay, then.</font>

145
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:59,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Cucumber and, uh, what's this? Moromi miso?</font>

146
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:01,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah. What's it worth to you?</font>

147
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:09,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's the matter?</font>

148
00:11:17,290 --> 00:11:19,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's worth 2,867 yen.</font>

149
00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:21,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh! That's a new record...</font>

150
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:27,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wait. Isn't that about the same
 as the remaining balance?</font>

151
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:32,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It feels like I've been taking advantage 
of you this whole time, Yanami-san.</font>

152
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:36,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't think that's right. 
The bentos were really good, though.</font>

153
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thanks for everything.</font>

154
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:49,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This did all start because I didn't have 
enough money, but I'm enjoying it now.</font>

155
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:53,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't want to call it off just like that.</font>

156
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:58,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">People have been spreading rumors 
about us eating lunch together.</font>

157
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:01,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You don't want that, do you? 
People thinking that we might be—</font>

158
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Listen. I don't know 
where you're going with this.</font>

159
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:08,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Did I do something to hurt your feelings?</font>

160
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:08,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No!</font>

161
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, you didn't.</font>

162
00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:16,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But I just don't like it.</font>

163
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:21,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't want people spreading 
rumors like that about us.</font>

164
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:27,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Okay, fine.</font>

165
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:32,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's fine with me. 
I won't talk to you anymore.</font>

166
00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:36,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thanks for everything. 
It was kind of fun. Bye.</font>

167
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You seem sorta out of it.</font>

168
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:56,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No need to worry. I'm always out of it.</font>

169
00:12:56,190 --> 00:13:00,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh? Or maybe you have someone on your mind?</font>

170
00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:03,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Not that it's any of my business.</font>

171
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:06,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But you'll regret it if you don't go talk to her.</font>

172
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:10,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Just some friendly advice from your senpai.</font>

173
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:23,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}<font size="18"><font face="Georgia"><b><font color="#07110c">You are

177
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So you were here.</font>

178
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:30,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I just came to return a book.</font>

179
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:34,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yanami-san, got a minute?</font>

180
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:38,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What is it? My friends are waiting
 for me, so keep it short.</font>

181
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:43,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">After eating lunch together
for all this time,</font>

182
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:47,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I think I actually started 
looking forward to it.</font>

183
00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:49,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So...</font>

184
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:50,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So?</font>

185
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:56,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I had fun, too. I just wanted you to know.</font>

186
00:13:57,130 --> 00:14:00,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh. Okay. Well, I'm going now.</font>

187
00:14:12,890 --> 00:14:13,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Komari?</font>

188
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:19,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yanami d-dumped you, huh?</font>

189
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:24,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I-I just came here to s-say,
 "Serves you right."</font>

190
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:27,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yanami-san and I weren't like that, though.</font>

191
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:32,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You th-thought you could be happy 
while we suffered. Y-You've got some nerve.</font>

192
00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:39,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Dumped, huh?</i></font>

193
00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:43,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I guess from the outside, it might have 
looked like we were in a relationship.</i></font>

202
00:14:55,930 --> 00:14:57,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hakamada.</font>

203
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:58,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've been looking for you.</font>

204
00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:00,250

00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:15,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What's the wallet for?</font>

208
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:18,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I was wrong. I misread the situation.</i></font>

209
00:15:18,810 --> 00:15:21,690

210
00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:24,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You've been seeing Anna recently, right?</font>

211
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:25,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

212
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:28,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">A couple was spotted fooling 
around by the old building.</font>

213
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:30,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Everyone's talking about it.</font>

214
00:15:30,210 --> 00:15:31,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, it's not like that!</font>

215
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:33,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That makes me so happy, man.</font>

216
00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:34,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, listen...</font>

217
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:38,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If Anna has a guy she likes now, 
I want to give her my support.</font>

218
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:40,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So please take good care of her—</font>

219
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:42,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You've got it all wrong!</font>

220
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:48,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You know Yanami-san always 
liked you, right, Hakamada?</font>

221
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, I guess...</font>

222
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:52,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yanami-san and I aren't like that at all!</font>

223
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:55,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She's still totally into you!</font>

224
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:59,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Now, what are we all talking about, I wonder?</font>

225
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:01,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Anna?</font>

226
00:16:01,690 --> 00:16:06,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Komari-chan messaged me saying Nukumizu-kun 
was getting bullied by some stud.</font>

227
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:11,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sorry, Anna. I just really hoped 
you'd find someone new.</font>

228
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:16,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Would you cut that out?</font>

229
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I just want you to be happy.</font>

230
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:20,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Stop.</font>

231
00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:23,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I know there are way better 
guys than me out there.</font>

232
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:24,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I said stop!</font>

233
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:25,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Anna!</font>

234
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:28,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Would you just stop?!</font>

235
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:31,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Listen, Hakamada. 
I don't care that you turned her down.</font>

236
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:34,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Pick up and dump all the girls
 you want. I don't care.</font>

237
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:39,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But you can't tell Yanami-san 
how she's supposed to feel.</font>

238
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:44,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If you do, she's gonna forget about how much 
she used to like you. Don't you get that?</font>

239
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:49,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You want her to be happy? 
To find someone new?</font>

240
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're the one who turned her down!</font>

241
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:54,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're the last person
 who should be saying that!</font>

242
00:16:57,190 --> 00:16:58,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey! You okay?</font>

243
00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:04,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're right. You're absolutely right.</font>

244
00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:09,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Okay. Sorry I got so pushy there.</font>

245
00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:13,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">"Turned her down"? "Turned her down"?! Shut up!</font>

246
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:17,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why are you pretending 
like this is some happy ending?!</font>

247
00:17:19,070 --> 00:17:20,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sosuke!</font>

248
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:23,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I always liked you, Sosuke.</font>

249
00:17:23,930 --> 00:17:26,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And I still like you! I'm not over you at all!</font>

250
00:17:26,810 --> 00:17:28,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Anna, I'm sorry—</font>

251
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:29,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No! Don't apologize!</font>

252
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:32,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Whoever I fall for next 
is none of your business.</font>

253
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:36,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Because I still really, really like you.</font>

254
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:43,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So go and be happy with Himemiya Karen.
 Go and be happy without me!</font>

255
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:51,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm gonna keep liking you if I want. 
I'll find someone else when I'm ready!</font>

256
00:17:54,970 --> 00:17:56,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey! Ow!</font>

257
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:02,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Uh, and I'm getting beaten up because...</font>

258
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:04,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There's no reason!</font>

259
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:08,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You should both feel bad. Sosuke,

352

367
