75
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:11,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We don't have a choice. I was busy

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>What about entrance exams?</i></font>

77
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:13,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So here's my idea:</font>

78
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:19,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">we take the web novels we wrote before 
and make them into a book. How's that sound?</font>

90
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:46,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Good. That settles it.</font>

91
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:48,880

can someone go help out in the library?</font>

93

108
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:54,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I won't get my hopes up, but sure.</font>

109
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:58,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, you see, Sosuke and Karen-chan

110
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:04,290

235
00:11:55,730 --> 00:11:59,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">When you said you made a friend recently, 
that was Yanami-san, wasn't it?</font>

236
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:00,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, yeah.</font>

237
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What do you say to inviting her over again?</font>

238
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:06,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I simply must give her a proper interview!</font>

239
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:07,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You don't need to interview her.</font>

240
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:11,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But she's just a friend. 
It isn't that big a deal.</font>

241
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:13,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's not like we hang out alon—</font>

242
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:15,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But that's how it always begins!</font>

243
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:18,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">When I saw her up close, 
she was a lovely person!</font>

244
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:23,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Big brother, is that from Yanami-san?</font>

245
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:25,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Um, it might be.</font>

246
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She's asking you out to tea!</font>

247
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:30,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Going to a café with a girl...
That's practically a date!</font>

248
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:31,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, it really isn't.</font>

249
00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:33,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><b><font size="16">{\an9}<font color="#767d79"><font color="#161712">You awake? If you have time, wanna 
get something to drink?</font></font></font></b></font>

250
00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:33,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><b><font size="16">{\an9}<font color="#767d79"><font color="#161712">Sure</font></font></font></b></font>

251
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:39,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>That's what I told Kaju, anyway. But going 
to a café with a girl during vacation...</i></font>

252
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:45,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Is that not what one would call a date?</i></font>

253
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:49,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>In all the light novels 
and manga I've read,</i></font>

254
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:52,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>even if you aren't going out,
it counts as a date.</i></font>

255
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:55,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Which means that Yanami...</i></font>

256
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:57,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>has asked me out on a date?!</i></font>

257
00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:03,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This world should perish.</font>

258
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:05,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Yup, this definitely isn't a date.</i></font>

259
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:10,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I knew this would happen. 
I knew this was how it would turn out.</font>

260
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:12,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But to see it happening before my eyes...</font>

261
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:15,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You mean when you see them
 flirting and stuff?</font>

262
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:19,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, they don't do a lot of 
flirting and stuff in public.</font>

263
00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:20,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Isn't that a good thing?</font>

264
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:23,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That isn't the issue!</font>

265
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:26,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She quietly cleans up after they eat,</font>

266
00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:28,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and he carries her bag 
for her like it's nothing.</font>

267
00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:31,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's that casual chemistry between them!</font>

268
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">When they meet, 
they communicate with just a look.</font>

269
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:38,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They share reward cards. 
Their ringtones are the same.</font>

270
00:13:38,090 --> 00:13:41,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And then, they walk home together
without saying anything first!</font>

271
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:49,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Damn straight! They're like newlyweds in heat
 who can't keep their paws off each other!</font>

272
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:50,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Would...</font>

273
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:50,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What?!</font>

274
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Would you like anything else?</font>

275
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No! We're fine!</font>

276
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:58,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Ooh, nice. Very nice.</font>

277
00:13:56,020 --> 00:14:00,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yanami-san, you're just having a 
cream soda today? You're not eating?</font>

278
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:07,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nukumizu-kun, listen closely.</font>

279
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:12,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Somen noodles are carbohydrates. 
They're essentially sugar.</font>

280
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Yeah, I know.</i></font>

281
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:16,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But those little guys are all cool 
and slippery, and they look so thin.</font>

282
00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:19,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Doesn't it seem like they'd be okay to eat?</font>

283
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:22,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Um, so you're saying you ate too 
much somen and gained wei—</font>

284
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:24,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, I have <i>not</i> gained weight!</font>

285
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:26,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But a cream soda is also mostly sugar.</font>

286
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:32,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Drinks don't count! There's a theory 
that ice cream doesn't make you fat.</font>

287
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:36,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They're dropping hints.</font>

288
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:37,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh? What's that mean?</font>

289
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:39,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nukumizu-kun, I want to 
drop hints like that, too.</font>

290
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:42,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll spread posts all around social media</font>

291
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:46,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">hinting that I'm with a boy 
to distract them and stuff.</font>

292
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:47,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>What's the point of that?</i></font>

293
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:51,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

294
00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:58,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's Ayano and Yakishio. 
What are they doing together?</font>

295
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:00,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nukumizu-kun, do you think they're cheating?</font>

296
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But they've been friends a long time.</font>

297
00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:05,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They're cheating.</font>

298
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:11,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But like, if you and Hakamada went somewhere 
together, that wouldn't be cheating, would it?</font>

299
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:12,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's cheating!</font>

300
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:18,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Looks like they already left.</font>

301
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:21,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, maybe we should call it 
for today. I'll see you later.</font>

302
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:23,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're giving up already?</font>

303
00:15:33,330 --> 00:15:37,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, Nukumizu-kun. Do you know that girl?</font>

304
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:41,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hello there. Do you remember who I am?</font>

305
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:44,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Um...</font>

306
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:47,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's me, Asagumo Chihaya!</font>

307
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:51,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, Ayano's girlfriend, right?</font>

308
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:55,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes! Did you happen to see Mitsuki-san 
and Yakishio-san come this way?</font>

309
00:15:55,930 --> 00:15:57,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah, they were—</font>

310
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:59,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">G-Gosh, I really couldn't say.</font>

311
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So you did see them.</font>

312
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:05,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Uh, see them? Well, yes, but...</font>

313
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Shall we... find somewhere 
more comfortable to talk?</font>

314
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:17,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Why does it have to be my room?</i></font>

315
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:21,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is this poster made out of cloth?</font>

316
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:23,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You mustn't ask that, Yanami-san.</font>

317
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:26,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It is polite to pretend not 
to notice things like that.</font>

318
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:31,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, so this is the kind of poster you'd 
be embarrassed to show other people?</font>

319
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:36,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If a girl from class saw I had a tapestry
 full of beautiful girls in underwear,</font>

320
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:37,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't know how I'd live with myself.</font>

321
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:40,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hold on! That isn't underwear!
They're combat uniforms!</font>

322
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:43,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If they're combat uniforms, 
why are they showing so much skin?</font>

323
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:47,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's because they release 
mana from their skin...</font>

324
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">for the, uh, Sigma Drive.</font>

325
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:55,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, I see. So why are the girls 
crawling on top of each other in bed?</font>

326
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:59,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Someone put me out of my misery!</font>

327
00:16:59,830 --> 00:17:04,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">When the five Awakened join together, 
the Sigma Drive begins to resonate,</font>

328
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:08,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and that allows the legendary weapon, 
Pashupatastra, to be unsealed.</font>

329
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:12,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So you see, there is a valid reason 
for these girls in combat uniforms</font>

330
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:13,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">to be physically connected.</font>

331
00:17:14,210 --> 00:17:18,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>She just kind of spoiled it. 
I haven't read that far yet.</i></font>

332
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:18,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}I've brought drinks for everyone.</font>

333
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:19,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}I apologize for visiting unannounced.</font>

334
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:19,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Woohoo! Thanks!</font>

335
00:17:24,050 --> 00:17:26,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So what did you want to talk about?</font>

336
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:30,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes, of course. I would like to 
be completely honest with you.</font>

337
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:34,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I suspect Mitsuki-san is cheating on me.</font>

338
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:37,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I have been following him 
to try to catch him in the act.</font>

339
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:42,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So if possible, I would like to ask
 you two for your assistance.</font>

340
00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:44,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sorry, but—</font>

341
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:47,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I guess I don't really mind assisting.</font>

342
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:47,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yanami-san?!</font>

343
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:53,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I am aware that those two were 
childhood friends. And I am aware that...</font>

344
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:56,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">she has a crush on Mitsuki-san.</font>

345
00:17:56,380 --> 00:18:07,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><font face="Impact"><b><font size="16"><font color="#d9e7e4">Black Thunder</font></font></b></font></font>

346
00:17:57,300 --> 00:18:02,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I like Mitsuki-san very much. 
That's why I want him to be happy.</font>

347
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:06,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Even if that means he 
doesn't remain by my side.</font>

348
00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:07,350
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you saying...</font>

349
00:18:08,810 --> 00:18:10,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've been wondering for quite some time...</font>

350
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:15,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">if maybe he should've dated her instead.</font>

351
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:20,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It may look like I came out of nowhere 
and stole Mitsuki-san from her.</font>

352
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:24,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's why I want to ascertain 
Mitsuki-san's true feelings.</font>

353
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:31,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If he truly does have feelings
 for Yakishio-san, then I'm...</font>

354
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:33,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">prepared to step aside.</font>

355
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:39,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It feels like my brother
 is going very far away.</font>

356
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:45,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If it comes to that, Nuku-chan, 
I'll take you as my own.</font>

357
00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:47,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But I want my brother.</font>

358
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:51,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nuku-chan, you're such a cutie.
 C'mon and be my bride already.</font>

359
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:53,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't wanna.</font>

362
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:04,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why did you decide to help her, Yanami-san?</font>

363
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:08,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Did you see the look on Lemon-chan's face 
when she was walking with Ayano-kun?</font>

364
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:12,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You wouldn't look like that with 
someone you've really given up on.</font>

365
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:16,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">When push comes to shove, the only people 
who can really watch over Lemon-chan,</font>

366
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:19,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">or really chew her out,
 are you and me, right?</font>

367
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:26,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are he and Lemon-chan here?</font>

368
00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:30,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes. They appear to be visiting 
the food carts one by one.</font>

369
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:31,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We should wait here.</font>

370
00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:35,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How did you know they'd be meeting here?</font>

371
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:37,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">With GPS.</font>

372
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:40,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>She said that like it was nothing!</i></font>

373
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:40,990
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So then—</font>

374
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:42,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Voices down! They're here!</font>

375
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">At the Italian gelato shop.</font>

376
00:20:03,930 --> 00:20:06,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an7}<font size="15"><b><font color="#747c7f">Paperback Book Cover</font></b></font></font>

377
00:20:11,470 --> 00:20:12,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Asagumo-san?</font>

378
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:18,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What a lovely book cover. 
Don't you think he'd love it?</font>

379
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:21,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah, that's nice. He does love books.</font>

380
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:26,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Mitsuki-san says he wants to find 
a job that has to do with books.</font>

381
00:20:26,930 --> 00:20:30,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The first time he told me that,
 I was quite surprised.</font>

382
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:35,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I realized someone who shared my dream
 was standing right beside me.</font>

383
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:43,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You know, he really dislikes sweet things.</font>

384
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:46,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I was aware of that, so I've never 
suggested anything like that.</font>

385
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:52,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So I've never gone out to eat anything 
sweet with him, like gelato.</font>

386
00:20:52,890 --> 00:20:56,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Uh, okay... but hey, what about savory crêpes?</font>

387
00:20:56,690 --> 00:21:01,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And the gelato Ayano was eating may not 
have been a sweet one. Like, uh, tuna mayo?</font>

388
00:21:01,290 --> 00:21:04,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Tuna mayo by itself would 
give him an upset stomach.</font>

389
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:07,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Mitsuki-san would need 
something like a salad.</font>

390
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:16,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I envy Yakishio-san. She's straightforward 
and expresses her feelings clearly.</font>

391
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:21,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">All I ever think about is how 
I don't want to upset Mitsuki-san.</font>

392
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:25,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm sure it's fine if you want to 
eat ice cream together sometimes.</font>

393
00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:29,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He isn't the type to get upset 
over a request like that.</font>

394
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:35,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're actually a very kind person, 
Nukumizu-san. I had you all wrong.</font>

395
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:38,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I think the entire school has me all wrong.</i></font>

396
00:21:42,530 --> 00:21:43,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This way!</font>

397
00:21:43,530 --> 00:21:44,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">H-Hey, wait!</font>

398
00:21:47,910 --> 00:21:50,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ayano? Wasn't Yakishio with him?</font>

399
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:51,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It was only Mitsuki-san.</font>

400
00:21:52,610 --> 00:21:54,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll check out the situation outside.</font>

401
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:04,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nukumizu-san, I deeply 
regret to inform you...</font>

402
00:22:04,050 --> 00:22:04,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes?</font>

403
00:22:05,690 --> 00:22:07,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Mitsuki-san has found us.</font>

404
00:22:11,450 --> 00:22:13,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why are you guys here together?</font>

405
00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:15,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">U-Um...</font>

407
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:18,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I would like to suggest that...</font>

408
00:22:21,030 --> 00:22:23,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nukumizu-san explains it all to you.</font>
