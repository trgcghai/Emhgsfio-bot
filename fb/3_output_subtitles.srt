2
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:37,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I was thirsty and wanted a drink of water.</font>

3
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:40,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So you c-came all the way out here?</font>

00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:43,550

5
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:46,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're out fountain-hopping
 to avoid class, right?</font>

6
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:53,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sh-Shut up. I-I came here 'cause I'm 
kind of d-doing research on school water.</font>

7
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:55,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Research? Oh?</font>

8
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm actually quite particular 
about the water here at school.</font>

9
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:06,130

drink water th-this morning?</font>

10
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:08,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Heh. If it's early in the day,
like first or second period,</font>

11
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:12,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">it's gotta be west building, second floor,
 next to the classroom.</font>

12
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:16,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">At that time of day, the water in 
the pipes is still from the day before.</font>

13
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:20,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Not only does it have less of a chlorine taste,
but it's cool in the morning, even in summer.</font>

14
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's the finest drinking water.</font>

15
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:28,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's...</font>

16
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:30,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's weak.</font>

17
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:32,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What? How can you say that?</font>

18
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:39,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">W-West building, second floor is b-best 
during lunch break, just before lunch.</font>

19
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lunch break, you say?</font>

20
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:44,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But there's no way the upper floors 
are fit for use after noon.</font>

21
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:47,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The chlorine smell gets stronger 
and the water becomes lukewarm.</font>

22
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:50,380

 on the s-stomach.</font>

24
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:57,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wha... B-But the chlorine...</font>

25
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:01,910

to the ch-chlorine smell...</font>

00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:11,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">...i-it covers up the smell of the bathroom.</font>

28
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Y-You eat lunch in the bathroom?!</font>

29
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:17,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I wish I'd never asked.

284
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:19,600

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">H-How would I add a subtitle?</font>

286
00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:27,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, let's see. If the title was
"The Literature Club Goes to the Beach,"</font>

287
00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:31,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">then maybe, "But We Didn't Realize It Was 
an Enforced Nudist Beach," for example!</font>

288
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:36,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Or "Is it True You Get More Points 
the More You Strip?" for example!</font>

389
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm just teasing.</font>

390
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Idiot! Watch out!</font>

391
00:20:55,730 --> 00:20:57,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Komari-chan, are you hurt at all?</font>

392
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:00,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I-I'm okay.</font>

393
00:21:06,050 --> 00:21:07,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">President, your hand...</font>

394
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:11,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't worry about me. What would've 
happened if you'd injured your face?</font>

395
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:14,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I-It doesn't really matter 
if my face gets hurt.</font>

396
00:21:14,810 --> 00:21:16,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't be stupid. Of course it matters.</font>

397
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:20,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nobody looks at my face or anything, anyway.</font>

398
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:22,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, you do, right?</font>

399
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:28,410
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do you really want to relive a bad memory 
every day when you look in the mirror?</font>

400
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:30,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I wouldn't want that to happen.</font>

401
00:21:31,050 --> 00:21:32,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">P-President...</font>

402
00:21:35,150 --> 00:21:39,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So don't say stuff like that. 
You gotta take care of yourself. Okay?</font>

403
00:21:57,750 --> 00:22:00,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">President Tamaki...</font>

00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">P-President...</font>

408
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:17,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I-I've always liked you.</font>

409
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:21,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You actually pay attention to me.</font>

410
00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:22,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It makes me so happy.</font>

411
00:22:22,430 --> 00:22:26,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I like you. So please...</font>
