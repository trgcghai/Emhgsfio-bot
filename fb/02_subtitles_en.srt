00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:14,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, not you.</font>

131
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:19,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Someone around 30 with 
a steady job would be ideal.</font>

132
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:23,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Uh, the next time I see my relatives, 
I'll ask if they can think of anyone.</font>

133
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:27,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, how sweet. When Konami finds 
her ideal man, I'd sure like to ride...</font>

134
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I mean, I'd sure like to meet him.</font>

135
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:32,110
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll never let you near him, Konuki-chan!</font>

136
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:34,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}And you'll have to watch 
the wedding remotely!</font>

137
00:08:33,170 --> 00:08:38,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>This is such a bad influence on the kids.
 I wish they'd hurry up and leave.</i></font>

138
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,670
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}How about from behind frosted glass?</font>

139
00:08:36,670 --> 00:08:37,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Sure, that works.</font>

140
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:38,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Hurray!</font>

141
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:41,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That last one was well-done.</font>

142
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>S-Something's coming.</i></font>

143
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:50,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How's it go-oooh-ing?</font>

144
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nice to see you, Yanami-san.</font>

145
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:55,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, you do have guests!</font>

146
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:58,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Your costume's a little dirty. Is it okay?</font>

147
00:08:58,220 --> 00:08:59,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah, it's chocolate.</font>

148
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The kids who come over to see me 
all have chocolate on their hands,</font>

149
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:07,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">or bits of candy stuck around their mouths.</font>

150
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:10,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I don't know why, 
but that kind of makes sense.</i></font>

151
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:13,970
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll watch the shop for a while, 
so you guys go take a break.</font>

152
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:16,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Okay, thanks. Back in a bit.</font>

153
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:21,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">One more thing. Don't you dare 
set foot in the clubroom, okay?</font>

154
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">B-But I have a book I need to finish.</font>

155
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:26,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then I shall burn it.</font>

156
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,640
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Then where are we supposed to go?</font>

157
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:32,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You are both going to go 
and enjoy the festival.</font>

158
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">B-But I don't really want to—</font>

159
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:39,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">As a girl in a literature club, 
you at least need a boy or two to dote on you.</font>

160
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:43,660
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I know this is Nukumizu-kun we're talking 
about, but he's still a boy. Right?</font>

161
00:09:58,150 --> 00:10:00,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">U-Um, Nukumizu.</font>

162
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hmm?</font>

163
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:07,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">S-Someone in the classroom just now told 
me they wanted time to read the reports,</font>

164
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:09,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and asked if they could 
take pictures of them.</font>

165
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:11,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Really? That's great.</font>

166
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:13,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah.</font>

167
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:18,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Where should we go after we eat?</font>

168
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:22,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I d-don't care. Anywhere you want is fine.</font>

169
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:21,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Here. Open wide.</font>

170
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:25,390
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Mmm! It's so good!</font>

171
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:31,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>If you didn't know any better, it could look
 like there was something between us.</i></font>

172
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:33,940

173
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:37,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Komari. I have a suggestion to make.</font>

174
00:10:38,810 --> 00:10:41,780
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">As an experiment, would you mind
 calling me "big brother"?</font>

175
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:47,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">H-Have you gone totally nuts?</font>

176
00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:50,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, wait. I don't mean anything weird by it.</font>

177
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:55,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But when we're eating together like this, 
it almost looks like we're here on a date.</font>

178
00:10:55,710 --> 00:11:00,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Then again, when they see a girl choking on

183
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:25,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Um, I brought Komari from my club with me.</font>

184
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:26,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh!</font>

185

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You're <i>that</i> Komari-san? The reports you 
wrote for the exhibit were wonderful!</font>

187
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:38,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh? U-Uh, well, thank you 
very much for your help.</font>

188
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:41,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Not at all! I found it fascinating!</font>

189
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:45,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I was especially enthralled by how it so 
skillfully aligned male social camaraderie</font>

191
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:50,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You must be a tremendous 
fujoshi, Komari-san.</font>

192
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:55,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't have any other fujoshi friends,

194
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:06,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I got a message from Yakishio.</font>

195
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:09,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What do you think? 
Wanna say hi before we go back?</font>

196

197
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:16,400

260
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:40,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">We sold 40 treats and 
14 copies of our newsletter.</font>

00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:44,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I couldn't have ended my 
presidency with a better event.</font>

262
00:15:45,050 --> 00:15:47,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And it's all thanks to you guys.</font>

263
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:56,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Shintaro, are you okay?</font>

264
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:58,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't worry. It's nothing.</font>

265
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:06,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>{\an8}It is 4 PM. The 98th Tsuwabuki 
Fest has now concluded.</i></font>

266
00:16:11,190 --> 00:16:14,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I guess this means you two have
"graduated" from the club now.</font>

267
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That makes me a little sad.</font>

268
00:16:16,170 --> 00:16:18,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, that's a nice thing to say.</font>

269
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:22,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But I bet you're really thinking, 
"Good riddance!" aren't you?</font>

270
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:25,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Polite conversation greases
 the wheels of society.</font>

271
00:16:27,310 --> 00:16:30,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You've become a pretty 
smooth talker, Nukumizu-kun.</font>

272
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:38,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I think Komari's feeling some pressure 
over becoming the club president.</font>

273
00:16:38,810 --> 00:16:40,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm sure she is.</font>

274
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:46,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">There's already a presidents' meeting
 coming up next weekend.</font>

275
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:49,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">People will be giving self-introductions 
and club activity reports.</font>

276
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:54,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Do you think you could help 
support her for just a little bit longer?</font>

277
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I wish I could.</font>

278
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:01,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But that's your role now, Nukumizu-kun.</font>

279
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:07,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't mean it in a romantic way,</font>

280
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:10,400
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but you're the only one 
who can stand by her side.</font>

281
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:12,360
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's how it is now.</font>

282
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:17,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't really know... but it feels like 
Komari doesn't let me get too involved.</font>

283
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:22,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Are you sure? I think Komari-chan 
really depends on you, Nukumizu-kun.</font>

284
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:27,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's why I wanted you to be vice president.</font>

285
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:31,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But it's still very different from 
the way you two handled things.</font>

286
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:36,860
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">When something's important, 
she has a habit of pushing people away.</font>

287
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:40,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The only people she lets in are you and...</font>

288
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:46,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The president sure is late.</font>

289
00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:49,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The fact that you and I are here</font>

290
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:51,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">must mean he's alone 
with Komari-chan right now.</font>

291
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:54,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah, I guess.</font>

292
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Would you like one?</font>

293
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't mind if I do.</font>

294
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:15,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You know, I'm actually a
very cold, calculating bitch.</font>

295
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:16,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Okay...</font>

296
00:18:17,210 --> 00:18:21,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I knew Komari-chan had a thing 
for Shintaro way before she told him.</font>

297
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:25,770
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But I thought she'd never make a move.</font>

298
00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:29,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I definitely underestimated her.</font>

299
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:32,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I was sure I'd never lose to a girl like that.</font>

300
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:38,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But that night at camp, 
if Komari-chan hadn't been so brave,</font>

301
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:41,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and Shintaro and I hadn't talked things out,</font>

302
00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:44,340
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">everything might have
 turned out differently.</font>

303
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:52,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">After all of it, it feels like I used Komari-chan 
as a stepping stone to my own happiness.</font>

304
00:18:53,930 --> 00:18:57,950
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Is that why you've deliberately given
 the two of them some alone time?</font>

305
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:18,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I-I'm done.</font>

306
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:21,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Did you get to talk to the prez?</font>

307
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:25,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I-I gave him my thanks.</font>

308
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:30,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, good. He's been such a great guy to me 
all this time. I really should thank him, too.</font>

309
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:35,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">N-Nukumizu, you only joined 
the club a little while ago.</font>

310
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:38,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">On paper, I'm still your senpai, though.</font>

311
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:43,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">D-Did you forget that you were a g-ghost 
member and I dug you out of your grave?</font>

312
00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:45,720
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Was I really dead and buried?</font>

313
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:56,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I-I've had so much fun in the literature club.</font>

314
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:04,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm s-so grateful to our senpai. 
The p-president even thanked me.</font>

315
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:09,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">He said it was all because of me
 the club had made it this far.</font>

316
00:20:10,370 --> 00:20:11,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That was nice of him.</font>

317
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:13,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Y-Yeah. But...</font>

318
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:19,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I-I know I'm going to start 
seeing him less and less now,</font>

319
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:26,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and my feelings for him are going to get 
weaker and weaker, and I don't want that.</font>

320
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:30,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Maybe it's for the best.</font>

321
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:32,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">For the best? Why?</font>

322
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How should I put it?</font>

323
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:38,440
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't really like the phrase, 
"Time heals all wounds,"</font>

324
00:20:38,910 --> 00:20:43,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but I do think some things 
need time to resolve themselves.</font>

325
00:20:45,130 --> 00:20:48,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">F-Funny coming from someone 
who's never been dumped.</font>

326
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:58,460
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I kind of get it, though.</font>

327
00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:04,030
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I-It's painful to hold on to something,
just waiting for it to end,</font>

328
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:09,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">s-so I'm glad I got to let 
some of my feelings out today.</font>

329
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:13,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">W-Wait, you didn't ask him
 out again, did you?</font>

330
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:16,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What? Th-There's no way I'd do that.</font>

331
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:20,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I j-just asked him if he ever liked me.</font>

332
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:21,500
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

333
00:21:22,930 --> 00:21:29,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah. I asked him if Tsukinoki-senpai hadn't 
been here, would he have liked me instead.</font>

334
00:21:30,770 --> 00:21:32,910
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And what did he say?</font>

335
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:37,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">H-He's always so kind.</font>

336
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:43,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I-I really enjoyed the time the three of us
spent together. Him, me, and Tsukinoki-senpai.</font>

337
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:45,870
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But...</font>

338
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:52,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wh-When we were at camp, 
I was ready to throw that all away.</font>

339
00:21:52,990 --> 00:21:59,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">S-So I told him I wasn't just trying to 
make a good memory out of all of this.</font>

340
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:07,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">B-But even then, he accepted all of me.
 Even the negative parts.</font>

341
00:22:22,610 --> 00:22:23,480
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I...</font>
